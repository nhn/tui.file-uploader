1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:01,705
- Clones.- Clones?

2
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:03,073
Well, we don't usethe c-word.

3
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:04,174
Genetic identicals.

4
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:05,842
Yeah, we count nineof us, so far.

5
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:08,578
We're like lab ratsin an illegal experiment.

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,913
It's an electrode.

7
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,481
It monitors

8
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:12,749
electrical activityin the brain.

9
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,901
Just tell me what happensto the results.

10
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,020
They go to Olivier.

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,420
Olivier, what are you doing here?Is something wrong?

12
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,322
Weneed to talk about Beth.

13
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:21,256
We need to try and behonest with each other.

14
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:23,243
I'm not doing anyof this by choice.

15
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,678
So they forced youto be Beth's monitor

16
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,346
for two years, withoutever knowing why?

17
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:27,814
I did peek.

18
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:29,349
You have killer grades.

19
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,018
Delphine.

20
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,986
Cosima. Hey, Cosima,you were right.

21
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:35,355
Paul doesn't even knowabout clones.

22
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:37,090
I may have a monitordilemma of my own.

23
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,996
It's me, this time.I know.

24
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:44,831
Is someone trying to hurt us?

25
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,934
I need you to tell mewhere I came from.

26
00:00:46,936 --> 00:00:50,437
Neolution gives usthe opportunity

27
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,906
at self-directedevolution

28
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:56,176
and I believe that'snot only a choice,

29
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:59,613
but a human right.

30
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:06,420
Olivier called Paul inhours ago,

31
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:07,554
and he's not picking up.

32
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:09,556
Well, that isn't out ofthe ordinary, is it?

33
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:12,826
How should I know?

34
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:14,261
There's nothing normal

35
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,296
about any of this, is there?

36
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,432
Sarah, this isthe new normal, okay?

37
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,000
So, Paul's a monitor.

38
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,969
He reports to Olivier,his handler, right?

39
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,504
As long as Paul is on our side,

40
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:25,772
we can start to finallyget some answers.

41
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:28,141
That's my point, Cosima.

42
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:29,610
What if he's not on our side?

43
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:30,978
I mean, what if he's

44
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,979
selling us out right now?

45
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,717
Let's go back eight months,

46
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,252
before Beth's shooting.

47
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:39,620
We already did, Olivier.

48
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:41,622
When you first stated

49
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:42,889
"she doesn't seemto be herself."

50
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:44,825
Yeah, she began abusing

51
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:47,594
prescription drugs.

52
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:49,096
Why are you taping this?

53
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:51,098
At the time, you felt it was

54
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,432
a typical response

55
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,767
to the stresses of police work.

56
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,102
Do you view it any differently,

57
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,436
in hindsight?

58
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:57,804
No. Her declineled directly

59
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,123
to her civilian shooting.

60
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,591
She only got worse from there.

61
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,852
This, through your lensas a former soldier.

62
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,628
If you told mewhat this was about,

63
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,963
perhaps I could help you.

64
00:02:05,965 --> 00:02:07,864
Perhaps you are helping me.

65
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,436
Don't do it, Cosima.

66
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,171
Stay away from Delphine, yeah?

67
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,605
Well, if we're going to

68
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:18,041
get past our monitors,we have to engage.

69
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,209
Yeah, look where that got me.

70
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:20,344
Into bed with him?

71
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:23,313
Okay, look whereit got Alison, yeah?

72
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:25,382
She smoked her husbandwith a golf club

73
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,917
on a hunch thathe was her monitor

74
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,685
and, now, they're awayat a couple's retreat,

75
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,187
trying to repairtheir marriage.

76
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,639
Okay, I'll obviouslyapproach Delphine

77
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,876
way more logically than that.

78
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:34,974
No, you won't.

79
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,127
Sarah, my situation is waydifferent than yours is.

80
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,563
Right, 'cause you're sucha brilliant scientist.

81
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:42,299
No, because she doesn'tknow that I know.

82
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,034
I'm the one who'smonitoring her.

83
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,502
Can you please juststay away from her

84
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:46,870
until I find out if Paul's

85
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:48,238
selling us down the river?

86
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Whatever.

87
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:53,343
Got anything else we needto be paranoid about?

88
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:56,513
God, I hope not.

89
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,267
Tomas?

90
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,669
Shh, shh shh.

91
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,873
Where am I?

92
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,341
You're getting stronger.

93
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:37,916
Orphan Black 01x07Parts Developed In An Unusual Manner
Original Air Date May 11, 2013

94
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,293
Olivier told Paul to meet him

95
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,228
at an underground club he owns.

96
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,397
That's Paul's car, so.

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,232
What a mess.

98
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:23,733
You know, even if he's not

99
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,268
ratting me out in there,those medical tests

100
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,903
could still tell himI'm not Beth.

101
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,305
Cosima said they wouldn't.

102
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,173
Yeah, well, she'sblinded by science.

103
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,676
Maybe, but, from everything

104
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:34,010
I found online,

105
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,046
she's right.

106
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,148
You and Beth are clones,

107
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,650
so you and Bethhave identical DNA.

108
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:41,751
Identical?

109
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:42,919
Yep.

110
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,422
The DNA samplesfrom the Jane Doe

111
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,257
in the gravel crusher

112
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,926
and the killerin the bathroom...

113
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,894
A match, same person.

114
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,864
That doesn't make any sense.

115
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:55,365
Someone in the labmust've messed up,

116
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,867
contaminated ormislabeled the samples.

117
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,101
Not on my watch.

118
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,337
Then what, Janice?

119
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,838
I took Jane Doe DNA

120
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,473
from a femur.

121
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,342
Our suspect killer's DNA came

122
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:06,843
from blood we foundin the bathroom.

123
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:09,713
Maybe the killer plantedJane Doe's blood there.

124
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:11,214
What, so she carriesaround a couple pints

125
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,549
of Jane Doe's blood andjust splashes it around?

126
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:14,151
Well, that's more likelythan she walked

127
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,652
into my lab and tamperedwith the samples.

128
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,947
Maybe someone withaccess tampered.

129
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,157
Are you trying to turn my ulcer

130
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,224
into a heart attack?

131
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:24,027
No, we're missing something,

132
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:26,296
from the very beginning,on this thing.

133
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:27,831
Yeah, I.D.s.

134
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,366
So, if the high tech's broken,

135
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,134
we do it the horse-and-carriage way.

136
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:33,203
Start from the beginning,

137
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,539
comb through that wholeshitpile again.

138
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,007
Oh, where's that

139
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,009
damn Jane Doe facialreconstruction?

140
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,677
It's coming.The face went

141
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,413
through a friggin'gravel crusher.

142
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:45,583
"Someone with access"?

143
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:48,985
Beth would nevertamper with evidence.

144
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,854
Okay, maybe not,but you had questions

145
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:53,370
about her run-in withthe killer, didn't you?

146
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,794
Square one, like the man said.

147
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,596
Open minds.

148
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,097
We'll see what we find.

149
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:06,002
Eh, hang on.

150
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,508
Oh.Cybergoths.

151
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,676
That's interesting.

152
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:13,977
I know those people.

153
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,412
Enough waiting.I need to know

154
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:17,347
what Paul's up to.I'm going in.

155
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,683
What? No!No!

156
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,484
You can't go in there,

157
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:22,819
with your recognizable mug.

158
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,454
Besides...

159
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:27,591
Clubland is my world.

160
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:31,528
You carry that aroundwith you everywhere?

161
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,596
Maybe.

162
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,472
Well, hello.

163
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,174
Neolution's a private club.

164
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:48,345
I know, but you look so lonely.

165
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,413
Not even a little.

166
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:52,415
Oh, good.

167
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,584
You look a littlemore important.

168
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:56,386
I...I... I...

169
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,055
I've come all the wayfrom Brixton

170
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:00,457
to party at Neolutionbefore I die.

171
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,992
My friends told meto mention Olivier.

172
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:06,096
You're dying?

173
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,564
Then you're not familiar

174
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,932
with Neolutionism?

175
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:11,701
Oh, there'san -ism.

176
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,136
¢Ü centipede

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,841
augmentation?

178
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:20,543
Self-directedevolution?

179
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,545
I'm intrigued.

180
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,481
Is everyone herea Neolutionist?

181
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,249
No, not everyone.

182
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,852
We've got technoprogressives,

183
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:31,655
body mods, biohackers.

184
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:33,089
Now, wait, what about your eye?

185
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:35,091
Is that a permanentaugmentation?

186
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,760
It will be, one day.

187
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,763
I've got other enhancements.

188
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,897
Right.

189
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,834
Well, a philosophyso... physical

190
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:47,537
makes for a veryhandsome tribe.

191
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:49,272
What about Olivier?

192
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:51,474
Is he enhanced?

193
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:53,543
Darling, you have no idea.

194
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:58,114
When's the last timeyou and Beth

195
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:00,116
were sexually intimate?

196
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:01,484
Three days ago.

197
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,086
Who initiated it?

198
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,421
She did.

199
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,922
How would you characterize it?

200
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,924
¢Ü Centipede

201
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,196
I'm not sure I understandthe question.

202
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,699
Would you describe theintercourse as intimate,

203
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,834
aggressive,

204
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:19,169
perfunctory,

205
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:20,170
sensual?

206
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,671
I would say passionate.

207
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,474
Beth's generallya "cold fish"...

208
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,042
Your words.

209
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:27,444
It's hard for me to help,

210
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:30,213
if I don't knowwhat's going on.

211
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:35,485
All of this architecture...

212
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,955
The psychological profiling,

213
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,924
physical exams,social metrics...

214
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:42,292
You must know

215
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,727
it doesn't existfor Beth alone.

216
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,028
I don't assume anything.

217
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,796
Of course you do.You're trained...

218
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:48,431
Surveillance, intelligence,

219
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,599
security.

220
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:53,503
The problem withclandestine ops is that

221
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,139
information and security

222
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,640
rarely gohand-in-hand.

223
00:08:57,642 --> 00:09:01,311
Which is why I have beentold rather late

224
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:04,948
that someone iskilling our subjects.

225
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:21,464
Thank you, Tomas.

226
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,433
Why did you letthe imposter live?

227
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:28,138
She's differentthan the others.

228
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,740
But how could it be different?

229
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:33,209
I don't know.

230
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,979
We have a connection.

231
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,970
But it's nothing.

232
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,550
Just one of yourfingernail clippings,

233
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,752
like the rest of them.

234
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,388
She said I am not the original,

235
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,357
that we are all the same.

236
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,406
How could you believesuch a thing?

237
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,642
Forgive me, Tomas.

238
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:42,212
Why are you following me?

239
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:43,847
I'm not following you.

240
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:45,615
Fine.

241
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,684
I thought you mightwant a blowjob.

242
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:48,685
Shit. Shit!

243
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:49,886
Hey, Paul, Paul.

244
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,121
He's with me, okay?He's my brother.

245
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,623
Jesus Christ, Sarah.

246
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,158
What are you doing here?

247
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,593
Sorry.I was worried.

248
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:57,727
What happened?

249
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,362
Not here.

250
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:01,364
Meet me at home.

251
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:03,800
Don't bring him.

252
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:05,568
Okay.You all right?

253
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,569
Yeah.

254
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,706
Your task is more difficult,

255
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,207
since the real Beth Childs

256
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:13,209
shot our friend Maggie Chen.

257
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,611
The copies,

258
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:16,880
they're harder to find.

259
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,115
Maybe we could usethe imposter.

260
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,650
I'd like to see her again.

261
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:23,920
Tomas.

262
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,890
It will say anything

263
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,758
to justify itself.

264
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,062
I'll be strong.

265
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:34,531
The path to the Shepherd

266
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,032
is through the sheep.

267
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:48,011
Find the impostor,

268
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,246
bleed it for what it knows,

269
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:51,681
then kill it.

270
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,034
You are the original.

271
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,536
You are the light.

272
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,471
I am the original.

273
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,972
I am the light.

274
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,284
Let's go overwhat you know again.

275
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,718
There's nine of you.

276
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,954
No! There'sonly one of me,

277
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:56,889
just like there wasone of Beth.

278
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,391
That's not what I meant.

279
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:00,593
Yeah, Beth figured outthere were nine of us,

280
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:02,261
so far.

281
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:03,763
I've only met Alison.

282
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:05,865
Who else knows,besides your brother?

283
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,900
Just me and Alison.

284
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:09,235
What about Alison's husband?

285
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,937
They've been togethersince high school.

286
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,172
He's not her monitor.We don't know that.

287
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,874
Don't lie to me, Sarah.

288
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,742
What is going on?

289
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:18,277
Is Olivier on to us, or what?

290
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,513
Olivier told me someoneis killing the subjects.

291
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:22,014
You know anything about that?

292
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,785
No.

293
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:26,853
Who?

294
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,555
He just said to watchBeth closely,

295
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,057
protect her, make sureshe's not aware.

296
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,226
Aware of what?

297
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:34,560
Of me, of us.

298
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,163
This is high-levelshit, Sarah,

299
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:39,365
an illegal human-cloning trial.

300
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,733
You think I don't know that?Aren't you the least bit worried

301
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,735
that someone might betrying to kill you?

302
00:13:42,737 --> 00:13:45,805
Yes.

303
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,541
But at least it's not you.

304
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:51,244
And I still needto see my daughter.

305
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,880
Take my car.

306
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,548
It's in the underground.

307
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,716
Why?

308
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:59,652
In case someone istailing you, all right?

309
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,387
My job is to keep you safe.

310
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,023
At least let me do that.

311
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:29,148
Shit!

312
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,183
I'm not here to hurt you.

313
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:33,152
I just want to talk.

314
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,721
Helena,just stay away from me!

315
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:38,991
Please. I havean offer for you.

316
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,060
But we must talk.

317
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:42,528
And eat.

318
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,831
Let's have lunch.

319
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,833
Lunch?

320
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:50,336
¢Ü They say we're youngand we don't know ¢Ü

321
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,072
¢Ü Won't find out

322
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,641
I dreamed thatwe were friends.

323
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,843
We're not friends.

324
00:14:57,845 --> 00:14:59,378
We will be.

325
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,781
I've seen it.

326
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:04,784
Don't they feed you,wherever you go?

327
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,320
¢Ü I got you

328
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,288
this is a nicerestaurant, isn't it?

329
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,491
Yeah, five stars.

330
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,394
¢Ü I got you, babe

331
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,630
mm.

332
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,266
You know my name.

333
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:21,701
Tell me yours.

334
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,836
This friendshipisn't there yet.

335
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:26,339
You're Russian?

336
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,140
No.

337
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,776
I grew up pure ina convent in Ukraine.

338
00:15:32,913 --> 00:15:34,313
Ukrainian nuns?

339
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,852
Is that who made youkill Katja Obinger

340
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,021
and the others?

341
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:43,222
No.

342
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:45,524
¢Ü I got you, babe

343
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:48,728
they saved mefrom abandonment.

344
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,032
Excuse me.

345
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:55,034
¢Ü I got you

346
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,069
I want my knife back,

347
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,571
the one you took from me.

348
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:03,709
Right, right,the flying-fish blade.

349
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,311
You got a thing forwings, don't you?

350
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,880
Mm.

351
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:12,184
I'm supposed to kill you, too.

352
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,419
But you let me live.

353
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:17,256
Yeah, so let'scall it even, okay?

354
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:18,758
We'll go our separate ways.

355
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,160
We'll never be separate.

356
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,531
Tell me the names of the others

357
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,400
and I will spare you.

358
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,834
You move your foot,

359
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:30,302
or I'll stab you again.

360
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,463
You have until midnight

361
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,899
to tell me the names.

362
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:06,572
Call this number,

363
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:08,841
or you die first.

364
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:11,277
¢Ü I got you

365
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,480
bye-bye.

366
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:21,253
¢Ü I got you, babe

367
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,289
¢Ü I got you, babe

368
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:27,593
¢Ü I got you, babe

369
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,095
¢Ü I got you, babe

370
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:40,506
Beth's paperwork's a mess.

371
00:17:40,508 --> 00:17:42,007
It's like she's never doneit before. Jane Doe's

372
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:43,509
fingerprint resultsaren't even filed here.

373
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:45,611
Yeah, I know.We ran 'em. No match.

374
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,113
Yes, Beth checked the results.

375
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,148
I remember, but even ifthere's no match,

376
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,950
they should still be here.

377
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:53,719
The man said double-check everything,

378
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,521
so let's get forensicsto pull the hand,

379
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:57,022
run a fresh set of prints.

380
00:17:57,024 --> 00:17:58,657
Oh, we're hitting the morgue?

381
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:00,192
Thought you'd like that.

382
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,227
Sweet.

383
00:18:08,236 --> 00:18:09,368
Hello.

384
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,405
You havea problem.

385
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:14,840
What kind of a problem?

386
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,342
I just received the results

387
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,210
of Beth's medical exam.

388
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,146
- Okay.- She's not Beth.

389
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:23,182
Well, which one is she,if she's not Beth?

390
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:24,516
That's none of your concern.

391
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,025
Just bring her in.

392
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:30,089
She's back?

393
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:31,590
Yeah, and she wantsyour names by midnight,

394
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:32,958
or I'm first on her hit list.

395
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,326
Holy shit, Sarah.

396
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,828
Don't worry.I won't give you up.

397
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,630
You know, maybe you should.

398
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:41,066
Not to Helena, but to Olivier.

399
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,735
What?

400
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,703
You were the one who said,if your blind subject

401
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,672
suddenly became aware,you'd terminate.

402
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,240
Right, well,

403
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:50,543
I'm beginning to rethink that.

404
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:51,977
Great, she's gota new hypothesis.

405
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,379
So, our creators,

406
00:18:53,381 --> 00:18:54,547
whoever they are, they have

407
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,917
a tremendous investmentin us, right?

408
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,451
Our conception,our whole lives.

409
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:00,886
Don't you think they'd try

410
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:02,655
to protect us from Helena?

411
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,890
They know somebody'swhacking us.

412
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,825
Shit.

413
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,294
Yeah, and Paul saidit's more of the same...

414
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,728
Observe your lab rat,

415
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,497
keep her stupid.

416
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:12,698
Do you know this futurist,

417
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,034
Dr. Aldous Leekie?

418
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,002
- No.- You know, he's the poster boy

419
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:19,205
for this movementcalled "Neolution".

420
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,673
Eh, Neolution?

421
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:23,175
Olivier owns a clubcalled Neolution.

422
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:25,344
Oh, that's interesting.

423
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,613
Yeah, Felix said it'sa bunch of biohack,

424
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,982
bodymod freaks.

425
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:32,051
Olivier's supposed tohave a tail.

426
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:33,586
A tail, for real?

427
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,587
Yeah.

428
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,288
That's what Felix was told.

429
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,258
Okay, well, tail or no tail,

430
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,893
they have a philosophy.

431
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,995
I went with Delphine

432
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,830
to one of Leekie'sNeolution lectures.

433
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:47,199
Cosima, you agreed to stayaway from Delphine.

434
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,101
No, I didn't.You just told me to.

435
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,737
You're going to end upstrapped to a gurney,

436
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,239
with doctors givingyou the probe.

437
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,673
I probably already have been.

438
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,542
Can we please justget back to Helena?

439
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,244
You know what?Just stay out

440
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,145
of my end, I'llstay out of yours.

441
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:01,981
Bitch.

442
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,382
Bitch.

443
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,152
Shit!

444
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,157
Shit.

445
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,526
Shit.

446
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,201
Hi.

447
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,202
Hey.

448
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:24,270
Sorry, I'm...

449
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:25,638
Oh, I'm early?

450
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
- No, no no no, I'm late, I'm late.- Okay.

451
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:29,208
I'm kind of alwayslate, though,

452
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,143
so, kind of always sorry.

453
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,646
Can you give metwo seconds? Just...

454
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:34,713
Of course.Okay.

455
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,438
Where is she?

456
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
How'd you get in here?

457
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,175
My key.

458
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:06,312
We bought this placefor you, remember?

459
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,746
So that you wouldnot only appear

460
00:21:07,748 --> 00:21:09,381
attractive to Beth, but,

461
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:11,984
moderately successful.

462
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:13,352
Where is your subject?

463
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:14,720
She's visiting Christine.

464
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:17,022
You were to keepa close eye on her.

465
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,124
It was a girls' lunch.I couldn't force the issue.

466
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,492
Astrid.

467
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:31,403
Your subject isn'twho we think she is.

468
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,542
She's an imposter.

469
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:38,143
I saw her justa few hours ago.

470
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,847
It wasn't her.

471
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,149
Is this a test of some kind?

472
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:49,655
The person killing our subjects

473
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:51,490
looks exactly like Beth.

474
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:54,460
You mean like a twin?

475
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:55,594
Yes, Paul,

476
00:21:55,596 --> 00:21:56,995
like a twin.

477
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:59,331
Now, get dressed.

478
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,042
Mom.

479
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:49,444
Sorry.

480
00:22:49,446 --> 00:22:51,446
Sorry, Monkey.

481
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,615
That was wonderful.That was really good.

482
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:54,983
Well, at least

483
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:56,685
she didn't get your tin ear.

484
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,253
I never learned to play piano.

485
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,289
You were too bad, weren't you?

486
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,190
Eh.Your mom just

487
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:03,725
didn't work hardenough at it, love.

488
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,395
All right, move over.

489
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,497
I want to teach her some queen.

490
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:10,232
Uncle Felix wasn't bad.

491
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,534
He was a different kind of bad.

492
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:13,835
What's this?

493
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,203
Mostly me.

494
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,638
But some of you.

495
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,735
Englandwas burning,

496
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,303
Maggie Thatcher

497
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:50,939
firing on all barrelsat Ireland,

498
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:53,275
the Falklands.

499
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,344
She sacked Social Security,

500
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,013
went after theimmigrants, the poor,

501
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,816
the unions.

502
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:03,452
What do you rememberabout Brixton,

503
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:06,321
about my people, then?

504
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:08,390
Not much.

505
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,158
There were alwayswomen around.

506
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,427
Kids would come and go,wards of the state.

507
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,229
They weren't all wards.

508
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:17,165
We were a...

509
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,001
A safehouse.

510
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:21,570
Some of us workedin Social Services,

511
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:23,839
helping womenand kids, refugees,

512
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,907
deportees,radicals on the run,

513
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:27,843
that kind of thing.

514
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,012
And...

515
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:32,381
This boy, Carlton.

516
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,749
Yeah, Carlton.

517
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:35,117
I remember him.

518
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,585
He was a fine boy.

519
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,121
Fine man.

520
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:42,324
Sometimes his pipelinewould bring in

521
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:47,295
a child in the black,a child to hide.

522
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,797
You were one of them.

523
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,033
Why'd he have to hide me?

524
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:54,836
We didn't ask what wedidn't need to know.

525
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:55,937
I had the chance

526
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,305
to legitimize a child,

527
00:24:57,307 --> 00:25:00,042
so I became yourlegal guardian.

528
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:04,246
The last time I heardfrom Carlton,

529
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:05,714
he was about to be arrested

530
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:07,215
and he warned me,

531
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:10,919
he begged me,to move you away,

532
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:12,487
to hide you deeper.

533
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:15,724
So,

534
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:20,896
I left everyone I knew

535
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:22,564
and I brought you

536
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:25,167
and Felix here.

537
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:38,580
I should've left himwhen I left Paris.

538
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:40,315
Mm, yeah, cold turkey,

539
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:41,650
it's the only way to go.

540
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,152
"Cold turkey", what is that?

541
00:25:44,154 --> 00:25:46,321
Oh, it means "abruptly".

542
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:48,356
Oh, yes, that"what I should've...

543
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:50,559
You know, he wassupposed to follow

544
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:52,060
next month, but,

545
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:53,428
I changed my mind.

546
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:56,732
Oh, my God.You're the asshole.

547
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,668
Mm-hmm, I am thecold-turkey asshole.

548
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:04,272
Dr. Leekie!

549
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:05,774
So nice to see you.

550
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,611
It's Dr. Leekie.

551
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,880
Should we invite him?

552
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:14,015
Your usual table?

553
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:15,383
You're single now.

554
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,220
Oh, no no no.He's too old.

555
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:19,688
But his mind is sexy.

556
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,056
Oui, c'est vrai.

557
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:22,858
I will go get him.

558
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:35,604
You know you guysalready checked

559
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:37,239
- the prints, right?- Oh, yeah.

560
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,307
We're looking at thewhole chain again.

561
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,247
Check that shit out.Finger straightener.

562
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:47,649
You are in the wrongdepartment, Angie.

563
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:49,017
You want her?

564
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,452
Ha ha.

565
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:52,721
Hey, you ever seen

566
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:55,357
a postmortem spasm?

567
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:07,969
Well, I'm still tryingto work it out

568
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:10,238
with my advisors,but my dissertation is

569
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,507
on epigenetic influenceon clone cells.

570
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:14,009
Oh, it's a fascinating field.

571
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:15,010
Yeah.

572
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,713
Are either of you familiar

573
00:27:18,715 --> 00:27:20,115
with our workat the Dyad Institute?

574
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:22,484
Oh, your immunologypapers, yes.

575
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,119
Then you'll be interestedin this too, Delphine...

576
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:27,322
We've created a pluripotent

577
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:29,758
stem cell line fromhuman baby teeth.

578
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,826
Dr. Leekie,

579
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:32,961
you've perfecteda number of proprietary

580
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:35,497
cloning techniques...in bacteria,

581
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,566
amphibians, insects,human skin grafts.

582
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,100
Correct.

583
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:40,268
And you're patenting

584
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,970
transgenic embryonicstem cells?

585
00:27:41,972 --> 00:27:44,673
We hope to, once we getthe necessary approvals,

586
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:47,475
but that is notpublic knowledge.

587
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:49,911
Yeah, I did some digging,

588
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:51,980
and then just guessed.

589
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,051
She...she is very, very...

590
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,686
- what's the word?- "Cheeky", I think,

591
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,821
is the word you'reafter, "cheeky".

592
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:02,324
She is very cheeky, this girl.

593
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:05,393
But that's why I like her.

594
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,770
Beth's dead?

595
00:28:15,772 --> 00:28:16,771
Why?

596
00:28:16,773 --> 00:28:19,040
I can't tell you that.

597
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,508
Who is she?

598
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,943
All I can tell you is

599
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:23,345
that she comes from Europe.

600
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,182
So, did this imposterkill Beth?

601
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:29,150
We suspect so.

602
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:30,819
And she's killedother subjects.

603
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,554
Yet, Paul, she still seems

604
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,855
to share your bed.

605
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:35,357
I don't know whatto say, Olivier.

606
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,686
To me, she's still Beth.

607
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:38,128
Regardless of what you think,

608
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:39,752
I need you to bring her to me.

609
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:42,998
Where in Europe?

610
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,499
Does that matter?

611
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,403
Yeah.

612
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:49,771
It's a big place.

613
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:53,141
England, Spain, what?

614
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:55,301
Whether I believe you or not,

615
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,680
loyalty is provenin the moment,

616
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,782
after all.

617
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:06,388
And loyalty has its rewards.

618
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,726
I know what I did, Olivier.

619
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,529
Help make this right,Afghanistan goes away,

620
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,965
you're free ofyour debt to us.

621
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,967
You get your life back, Paul.

622
00:29:18,969 --> 00:29:19,968
Okay.

623
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,005
Can I have my phone back?

624
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:26,374
What do you think,the both of you,

625
00:29:26,376 --> 00:29:27,876
of applying to the institute?

626
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:29,978
Who, us?

627
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,212
Well, why not?

628
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:32,814
You could be the nextWatson and Crick!

629
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,050
I'm just a geek girlfrom Berkeley.

630
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:37,752
I can tell you have

631
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:39,254
a very unique

632
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,756
perspective, Cosima.

633
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,692
Please, you could be

634
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,927
on the cover ofScientific American.

635
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,696
Scientific American

636
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:49,631
doesn't put scientistson the cover.

637
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:50,732
Well,

638
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,434
every rule needs to be broken.

639
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:00,075
Here.

640
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:08,516
If you... if youhave to go back

641
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:10,986
to go forward,I understand, but,

642
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,420
just tell me, okay?

643
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:13,922
It might still be dangerous.

644
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:16,491
Yeah, I think so, too.

645
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,862
I can keep Kira safe,

646
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:22,897
just like I kept you.

647
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:50,191
Put it on speaker.

648
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,360
One more story, mummy?

649
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:53,361
Ah!

650
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:55,096
You already hada story, didn't you?

651
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,565
It's time for bed. Oh.

652
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,634
Monkey-swingto Felix.

653
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:01,469
Okay.Oh, my gosh!

654
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,405
Come on, I'll squeezeyou to sleep.

655
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,140
I'll be right up, okay?

656
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:08,309
Do your teeth!

657
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:09,310
Hello?

658
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,545
Hi, Beth.

659
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,981
What's up?

660
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:14,382
Not much.

661
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:15,884
I need you to dosomething for me.

662
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:17,218
Okay.

663
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,120
They know you're not Beth.

664
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:20,221
Run.

665
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,512
Okay, I get it, I do.

666
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:39,946
Black-ops Pauljust proved

667
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:41,314
he's down with you for real,

668
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,316
but he also said run.

669
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,985
I can't just leavehim in there, Fe.

670
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,420
It's probably my fault

671
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:47,888
he's in there,in the first place.

672
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,790
Well, how do you evenknow he's still here?

673
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,291
I don't, but I've got to try.

674
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,793
So, then, what areyou going to do?

675
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,528
Are you going to takeCosima's bad advice,

676
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,962
fess up to Olivier?

677
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,834
I've got an even worse idea.

678
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,203
How was your day, Paul?

679
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:08,275
Yes, I also had a pleasant day.

680
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:10,444
I went working and shopping.

681
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,818
Pardon me.It's work.

682
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:22,355
It's almost midnight.

683
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,590
Do you have names for me?

684
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:24,725
I do.

685
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:26,393
Olivier.

686
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:28,028
That's not the name

687
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,696
of a sheep.

688
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,364
A sheep?

689
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,700
Baa!

690
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,235
Look, Helena,

691
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:39,072
he's more importantthan a sheep, okay?

692
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,507
He's a Shepherd.

693
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,943
I need you to come meet me.

694
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:53,086
I saw Paul come upfrom the basement.

695
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:54,521
I know that Olivier's office

696
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:55,889
has got to be down there.

697
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:04,030
Okay, if I'm not backin 15 minutes,

698
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,832
call Art,

699
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,267
tell him everything,

700
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,803
and make sureKira's safe, yeah?

701
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,004
Yeah, I...

702
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:12,873
Sarah!

703
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:13,940
What?

704
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:15,008
Um,

705
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,477
just don't die,

706
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,912
because your first funeral

707
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,047
was just agonizing enough.

708
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,120
What are you doing

709
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,721
down here?

710
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,058
I'm looking for Olivier.

711
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,394
Who are you?

712
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:16,069
You know how bad this can get.

713
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,938
I'm not working for anyone.

714
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,439
Then why protect her?

715
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,842
I told you she was a killer.

716
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:23,977
Was she that good?

717
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,479
I have Beth

718
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,981
to see you.

719
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,592
You must be Olivier.

720
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:39,726
Well,

721
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,595
this is unexpected.

722
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:43,096
She was carrying this.

723
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,401
I told you to run.

724
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,570
Yeah, I don't do run.

725
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,272
Leave us, please.

726
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,526
Call me as soon as you can.

727
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:17,330
All these years,I've never seen

728
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,232
one of you in the flesh.

729
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:21,501
You're even morebeautiful in person.

730
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:25,071
He thinks you're the killer.

731
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:26,106
Me?

732
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,809
You've got it all wrong.

733
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,579
We have medical evidence

734
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:34,214
that proves you're not Beth.

735
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:35,582
How can you tell that,

736
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:37,017
if we're genetically identical?

737
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:39,286
I'm not a scientist.

738
00:35:39,288 --> 00:35:41,454
Well, you've still gotthe wrong girl.

739
00:35:41,456 --> 00:35:43,290
The one who's killingus is blonde,

740
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,860
she's Ukrainian,she's a religious nut.

741
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:49,029
You've createda whole new brand

742
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,330
of fratricide.

743
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:53,633
You're not listening.It's not me.

744
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:56,636
Exquisite.

745
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,138
What do you people want?

746
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,773
The future.

747
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:02,776
Self-directedevolution?

748
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:03,944
You want to grow a tail,

749
00:36:03,946 --> 00:36:05,445
that's your business.

750
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:07,347
Oh, you know aboutmy modest enhancement?

751
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,082
You've got a tail?

752
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,216
The fact thatI can have a tail,

753
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,718
millions of yearsafter we shed it,

754
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,187
reminds me ofwhat we can achieve.

755
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:22,128
Would you like to see it?

756
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,131
God, no.

757
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,834
Argentinean biohack.

758
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,369
Blood flow, nerve endings,

759
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:31,604
warm to the touch.

760
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,039
But it's merelyperformance art,

761
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:35,108
compared to you.

762
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,011
You are our greatestachievement.

763
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:41,982
Perhaps later.

764
00:36:52,694 --> 00:36:54,227
This is Olivier.

765
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:57,931
What's so urgent?

766
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,299
I have her, Aldous.

767
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,234
The killer.

768
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:05,672
Get her ready to travel.

769
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:07,974
I'll be there in the morning.

770
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,442
And be careful with her.

771
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:25,792
She's irresistible,

772
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:26,926
isn't she?

773
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:33,199
Now I know why you did this.

774
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:34,868
If I was in your position,

775
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,936
I'd fall in lovewith her, too.

776
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:47,047
Shh, shh shh shh shh.

777
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,016

Oh, God!About time.

779
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,988

780
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,356
Yes, Helena!Untie me.

781
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,991

782
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:59,826
I gave you Olivier.

783
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:02,529
I want the nameof a sheep, too.

784
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:11,638
Okay, I'll give youanother name.

785
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,575

786
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,777
I offered you a way out,

787
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:19,813

789
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,085

791
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,714

792
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:04,524
Now, show me the tail.

793
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:05,625
Slowly.

794
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,030

00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,835

00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:18,204

806
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:49,736

00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,294
Hi, um, detective.

810
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:16,496

00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,665

00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:24,771
Shit! Christ!

815
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:25,872

816
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:26,873
Wrong number.

817
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:30,210
Hello?

818
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,211

I told her who I was.

822
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,014
Sarah?

823
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,916
She's got a thing for me.

824
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:31,462
Mm.

00:41:31,464 --> 00:41:33,130

by myself at Bobby's Bar.

828
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,703
We can't go backto the townhouse.

829
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:43,007
It's not safe. They'llbe looking for us.

830
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,708
We should...

831
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:11,435
Working withDr. Leekie could be

832
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:12,870
the opportunity of a lifetime.

833
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:14,405

834
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,340

00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:18,008
Then why are youbeing so coy?

836
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:22,012
Don't you think

837
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:23,447

838
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:24,548

839
00:42:35,894 --> 00:42:37,795

00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:40,264

Art, you got to see this.

852
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:15,299
Holy shit.

853
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,334
It's a matchon the Jane Doe print.

854
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:23,140
Who's Sarah Manning?

855
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,442
