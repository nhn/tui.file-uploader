Well, that's not fair, is it?

14

Two phones.

26
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,519
Oh, my God,

27
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,120
you look like crap.

28
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,956
Hi.

29
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,991
Hello.

30
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,592
No, but seriously.

31
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:38,761
Ew.All right.

32
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:40,663
How's life, Felix?

33
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:43,733
This long, no see?You don't get to know.

34
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,535
I didn't miss yourbirthday, did I?

35
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:48,137
No. I know. It'stotally pedestrian

36
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,839
and the only reason I'm here.

37
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,474
Oi, Bobby.

38
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:52,642
Hey, Felix.

39
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:53,876
Guinness?Yeah.

40
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,445
How's Vic the dick?

41
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,481
Yeah, I hit himfirst, this time.

42
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:02,051
With an ashtray, so...

43
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:04,353
He's a little blue.

44
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,192
Coke?

45
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,160
It's Vic's.Think you can flip it

46
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,795
to one of yourBay Street blow boys?

47
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:14,597
You have no ideawhat that costs me.

48
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,098
I'll give you 20%.

49
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,633
I wasn't talkingabout my cut, Sarah.

50
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,202
I was talking about my pride.

51
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:20,570
What are you up to?

52
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:21,938
I'm here for Kira, Fe.

53
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
After what happened,you really think Mrs S

54
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,474
is going to let you take her?

55
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,376
She's my daughter.She's going to have to.

56
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,612
You've been gonealmost a year, Sarah.

57
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:32,081
I'm not judging.

58
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,382
I'm just saying.

59
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:34,850
All right?

60
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:35,851
Ta.

61
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,253
Yeah, so I'm back on the run,

62
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,754
the usual Sarah shitestorm.

63
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,855
Apparently.

64
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,424
And on that note,something really weird

65
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,526
just happenedat the train station.

66
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,760
What?

67
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,696
I saw a girl kill herself.

68
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:48,397
Ew!

69
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,599
A jumper?

70
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,100
Yeah, and she looked

71
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,669
exactly like me, Felix.

72
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,272
What you mean?

73
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,909
Oh! You robbedthe body.

74
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,544
No, she left the bagon the platform.

75
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,646
Isn't that essentiallyrobbing her body?

76
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,855
Okay, that's weird.

77
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:13,889
Yeah, you think?

78
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,957
Elizabeth Childs?

79
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,126
It's you, with a nice haircut.

80
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,761
And a nice address.

81
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,796
What the hell, Fe?Did I have a twin sister?

82
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,298
Well, now, when you'rea poor little

83
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,900
orphan foster wretch,anything's possible.

84
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,437
Or so we tell ourselves.

85
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,806
I'm going to go up to her flat.

86
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,808
Yeah, to find out who she is

87
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,310
or to rob the rest of her shit?

88
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,778
No car. Therehas to be a car.

89
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,183
Is that her phone?

90
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,953
Yeah.Well, answer it.

91
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,060
Try and get 20k for it, yeah?

92
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,262
All right, fine.What about Vic?

93
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,800
I'll call ya.

94
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,535
Okay.Okay?

95
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,703
Okay.

96
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,414
Hello!

97
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,411
Boyfriend.

98
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,382
Squares.

99
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,321
Paul Dierden.

100
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:27,189
Out of town 'til Saturday.

101
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:52,047
Well?

102
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,049
Shit for quality.

103
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,885
I'll give you $10,000 for it.

104
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,620
10? With the hayroll?

105
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,655
You can do better.

106
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,457
I'll think about it.

107
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,758
Better think fast.

108
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,127
Okay.

109
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,530
Okay!

110
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:09,440
Shit!

111
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,069
What?

112
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,438
Where the hell is Sarah?

113
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,806
Shit, Vic!Where is she?

114
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,973
Can't. Breathe.

115
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,974
Oh!

116
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,342
Sarah!

117
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:22,278
Sarah?!

118
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,113
What the hellis wrong with you?

119
00:09:24,115 --> 00:09:26,248
Where the hell is Sarah?Toodles.

120
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,184
Where is she?!I don't know.

121
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,352
I haven't seen herin, like, a year.

122
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:31,587
She's been with you.Bullshit!

123
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,088
She's not my problem anymore.

124
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,423
Listen to me, Felix.I'm just going to

125
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,091
ask you once --Where. Is. The. Coke?

126
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:37,393
Cocaine?

127
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:38,527
Felix.

128
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,097
All right, fine.

129
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,767
Here.

130
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,836
Blow me.

131
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,004
That's really funny.

132
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,006
What the hell happenedto your head?

133
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,374
Well, let's see --Sarah blindsided me,

134
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,776
then she took offwith the coke.

135
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,845
Listen to me!Listen to me.

136
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,880
Listen!I'm under hook

137
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:00,015
with Pouchy.Look at me.

138
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,383
You understand?Look at me!

139
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,452
That's going tobring pain on me.

140
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,721
'Til I find her, it's on you.

141
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,829
You mind if I have this?

142
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,365
I'll be back. She betterbe here, fruitcake.

143
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,435
Lovely to see youagain, Victor.

144
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:21,337
Sarah.

145
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:22,605
It's "Beth".

146
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:26,542
So my credit is maxed, but,

147
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,078
I've got a sweet padand my new boyfriend,

148
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Paul's, out of townfor the weekend.

149
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,782
Unfortunately, your realboyfriend, Vic the dick,

150
00:10:33,784 --> 00:10:36,151
is already here.Shit!

151
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:37,653
Oh, I'm fine,by the way. Thank you.

152
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:38,854
I'm sorry, Fe.

153
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:40,956
Your blow is abysmal,by the way.

154
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,444
I'll be lucky to get10k for it.

155
00:10:42,564 --> 00:10:43,893
What?That's not enough.

156
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:45,261
For what?

157
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:47,029
To get out, Fe,set ourselves up

158
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,397
with Kira somewhere.

159
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,132
Sarah, who is Elizabeth Childs?

160
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:51,767
I don't know.

161
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:53,569
She's just a girlwho looks like me.

162
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,438
A girl with a pretty nice life.

163
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,001
If it's so nice,why'd she kill herself?

164
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,678
Hold on.

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,079
Fe, she's got

166
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,581
$75,000 in a savings account.

167
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,216
Say again.

168
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:09,318
75k!

169
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,920
The account was just opened,

170
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,056
like, 3 weeks ago.

171
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:15,958
That's enough to losebloody Vic, yeah?

172
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,493
We can get away with this, Fe,

173
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:18,761
the three of us.

174
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,396
Sarah, any second,someone's going to

175
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,398
I.D. the bodyand it's game over,

176
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,733
so you should really justdrop it all right now.

177
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,502
Nice work with theashtray, by the way.

178
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,304
Vic has stitches.Hello?

179
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,705
I'm standing outsideHuxley station right now --

180
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,106
Shut up.I'm thinking.

181
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,508
As you can see,it's emptying out.

182
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,909
Authorities havecleared out the station

183
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,111
after an unidentified womanfell onto the tracks

184
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,923
and was killed.Now, witnesses aren't sure

185
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,543
how the womancame to be on the tracks

186
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,311
or whether foul playwas involved.

187
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,547
- Fe! - Police have not releasedany more details.

188
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:45,602

00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:30,681
Ugh! Felix!

00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:31,682
Ow!

242
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:33,317
Use it or hang it up, okay?

243
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,453
Do not snap towelsat me, Bobby.

244
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,421
I had a verytraumatic childhood.

245
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,469
Yeah, hi. Um --

246
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:53,371

247
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,206
apparently, a girlkilled herself

248
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,707
at Huxley station last night

249
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,177

250
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,679
Sarah.Sarah Manning.

251
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:04,282
Beth?

252
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,283
Hi!

253
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,450
Good to see you again.

254
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:07,618
How are you?

255
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,187
Yeah, good, Stephen, thanks.

256
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,489
Busy.

257
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:14,158
I pred last week,at 2:14.

258
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,627
It was only a half,but it almost killed me.

259
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,629
How'd you do, yourlast charity run?

260
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:21,632
I...don't know,in fact.

261
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:24,368
I need to makea large withdrawal

262
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,937
from that account.

263
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,638
I see. Right,this is the one

264
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,006
you just opened.

265
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,875
Yeah, I'll leave $500 in,

266
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:33,110
to keep the account open,

267
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:34,679
but I need the rest,in cash, please.

268
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:36,280
Cash?

269
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:37,648
Yeah.

270
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,083
I'd really recommenda cashier's check, if you...

271
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,119
No, 50s and 100s, please.

272
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:44,088
Well, we don't keepthat much on hand.

273
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,591
See, anything over $10,000,we have to special-order

274
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,826
and that takes2 to 4 business days.

275
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:52,730
So...

276
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:56,100
Stephen,

277
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,269
what could I doto --

278
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,104
to push a rush on that?

279
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:03,241
You know, 24 hours.

280
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,877
Could I sponsor

281
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,314
your nextcharity-run thing?

282
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:14,485
You certainly can.Deal.

283
00:15:15,588 --> 00:15:18,389
But...

284
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,291
This card is --

285
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,727
I'm not even sure I'veactivated that yet.

286
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,762
If I did, I need to repin it.

287
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,931
Demagnetized, maybe?Yeah.

288
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,432
You know what?

289
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,034
Let's start with a new one

290
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,636
and then we'll organizethe withdrawal.

291
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:32,637
Okay.

292
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,139
Okay.

293
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:36,974
Do you want access

294
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:40,444
to your safe depositbox as well?

295
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:41,846
Oh, yeah.

296
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,181
I'd love that, Stephen.

297
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:51,188
"Where are you?Must see you".

298
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:55,760
Yeah, good luck with that.

299
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:07,705
Alison Hendrix.Elizabeth Childs.

300
00:16:09,341 --> 00:16:11,942
Katja Obinger.

301
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,567
What the hell are you doing?!

302
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,603
Shit.

303
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,505
Get in the car!

304
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,974
Yeah --no, thanks.

305
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:45,509
Look, get the car, damn it!

306
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,745
What's the charge?

307
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:49,146
Don't, Beth, not today.

308
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,951
We're late!

309
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:56,821
Yeah. Okay, yeah.Calm down.

310
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,532
Where were you?

311
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:10,101
We were going to walkthrough it again.

312
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:14,538
Uh, yeah, yeah.I got held up.

313
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,141
Don't worry about it.

314
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:18,509
I worry.Suddenly,

315
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:20,745
you don't give a damn,I get pissed.

316
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:24,081
My fat ass is on theline here, too.

317
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,650
Now, you had better be ready.

318
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,085
Are you ready?!

319
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:31,655
Yeah.Yeah, I'm ready.

320
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:34,158
You're sure as helloverdressed.

321
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,860
Were you out all night,or something?

322
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:39,363
No, you know what?Give me a second.

323
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,731
I'll go in and change.

324
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,133
Yeah, right.

325
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,934
You'd probably take offon me again.

326
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,370
Look, Beth, I know this shit is

327
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,172
as hard as it gets,

328
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:50,441
but you got to stopmaking it worse.

329
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,884
Art.

330
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:01,585
Just...drive.

331
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,289
Oh, is that her?

332
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,391
Yes, yeah.

333
00:18:07,393 --> 00:18:08,793
Are you okay?

334
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,227
Yeah.Yeah, I'm good.

335
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,228
Okay.

336
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,934
Colin, um --

337
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,736
can I call you Colin?

338
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,070
My mum does.

339
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:23,707
Ah. Um, well,don't get me wrong --

340
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,142
I usually do enjoycreepy, I do,

341
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:26,577
it's just, um,

342
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,046
the air in here,is that just me?

343
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,548
Because it smellslike --

344
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,617
Uh, no, it's death.

345
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:37,855
You can do this, though.

346
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,990
It can be a Gestalt.

347
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,091
Oh, my.

348
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,010
Holy shite.

349
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,912
Let's go.

350
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:28,372
Hey, good luck, Beth.

351
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,710
"Fashionably late,"you call that?

352
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,845
She's here, lieutenant.

353
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,680
You get busy.Detective, come with me.

354
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,315
Show's over!

355
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,584
Oh.

356
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:43,220
Stick to your statement

357
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:45,823
and you'll be fine, okay?

358
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,731
I got to -- I got touse the washroom.

359
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:55,499
Lieutenant.

360
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:57,268
All right.

361
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,870
Get yourself sorted.

362
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:01,338
Detective.

363
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,506
Yeah.

364
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:05,576
Washroom's this way.

365
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,577
Right.

366
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,768
Felix?Beth is a cop.

367
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,470
I'm a cop, Felix.Abort.

368
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:36,640
This will be shocking, Felix,

369
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:38,542
but, for her,it was instant. Okay?

370
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:39,543
Okay.

371
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,314
Oh, my God!I --

372
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,616

that's so --

374
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,662
All right, I can't.I can't do it.

375
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:00,130
You got --I need to --

376
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:01,632
That's too messed up.I can't.

377
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,934
It's okay.You can lean on me.

378
00:21:03,936 --> 00:21:05,669
All right.

379
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:33,230
Thank you.

380
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:38,669
Morgue water.Delicious.

381
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:39,737
Is it her?

382
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:41,105
Yeah.

383
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:43,340
Your sister.I'm very sorry.

384
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:44,842
Foster sister.

385
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,343
But we were very close.

386
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:47,845
You know, we spent all our, um,

387
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,346
formative years together.

388
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,649
Right.

389
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:54,118
Okay, well,there's a few things

390
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,754
you need to sign.

391
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:58,622
But if you --

392
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:02,192
if you need -- want --anyone to talk to,

393
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:04,261
you know,

394
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:06,530
over a drink or...

395
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,968
Well, aren't you an odd duck.

396
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:31,155
All right, statement ofofficer Elizabeth Childs,

397
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:33,290
entering into record her versionof the line-of-duty shooting,

398
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:36,527
7 October of this year,resulting in

399
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:38,862
a civilian fatality,one Margaret Chen.

400
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:41,665
In your own words, please.

401
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,201
Begin by stating your name.

402
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:53,610
Anytime, detective.

403
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:02,859
I panicked. What doyou want me to say?

404
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:05,276
Pretty much anythingbut "I panicked."

405
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,114
I'm kidding.

406
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:13,450
Where's your wit gone?

407
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,786
You haven't called me"dipshit" all day.

408
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:19,256
You don't have tobabysit me, dipshit.

409
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:20,357
I know.

410
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,493
But who else would?

411
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:24,628
Thanks, doc.See you next week.

412
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,397
Look, Beth,

413
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:27,898
I know this thing has got you

414
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,000
all twisted up,

415
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,568
but you got toforgive yourself.

416
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,871
Shootings happen.

417
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:36,173
To whoever's there withthe gun in their hand.

418
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,546
Dr. Bowerswill see you now.

419
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:58,062
Felix, open the goddamn door!

420
00:23:58,064 --> 00:23:59,563
Felix, I know you're in there!

421
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,198
Open the door, now!

422
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:06,036
Ooh!

423
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:08,505
You bastard.

424
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:13,277
What the hellis wrong with you?

425
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,847
Huh?

426
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:18,782
Where's Sarah?

427
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:20,751
Sarah's dead.

428
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:23,721
I'm sorry, what?

429
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,055
She's dead.

430
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,423
Vic.

431
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,325
She killed herself.

432
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,894
Yeah? Bullshit.Where is she, Felix?

433
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,297
She jumped in front of a train

434
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,966
because youare such an arsehole!

435
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,104
What's this?

436
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:41,472
Her death certificate.

437
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,974
Bullshit.It's not real.

438
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:46,110
I identified her body.

439
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:48,112
Vic, she's dead, she's gone!

440
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:50,114
Okay, Felix, stop.Stop! Stop it!

441
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:51,548
She told you to say this?

442
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,050
She's not dead.Where is she?

443
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,126
Stupid bitch.

444
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,798
Sarah.

445
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,011
It's not coming back to you?

446
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:24,348
Hmm, no, not really.

447
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,317
Uh, I know I shot a civilian.

448
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,253
Maggie Chen,

449
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,755
44, single, churchgoer.

450
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,724
I'm just missing --

451
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,392
Missing what?Explain.

452
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:36,994
Uh...

453
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:38,862
Myself? Um --

454
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,968
Yeah, I'm --I glitched,

455
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,005
break, or something.

456
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:52,276
I think I need some,you know, leave.

457
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:53,844
You're under suspension.

458
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:54,878
Right.

459
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
Ahem!

460
00:25:56,882 --> 00:25:58,382
See, I'm havingtrouble with detail,

461
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:03,053
so I'm not sure I shouldsay anything at all.

462
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:04,254
It's okay.I's all confidential.

463
00:26:04,256 --> 00:26:06,190
Have you shared anyof these dissociations

464
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:07,324
with Paul?

465
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:08,826
Yeah, no, we're fine.

466
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,427
I don't want to talkabout Paul.

467
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:11,662
Paul's away.

468
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,031
No, he's in Cleveland.

469
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,099
Beth,

470
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:17,668
uh,

471
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,236
a waitress makesa mistake at work.

472
00:26:19,238 --> 00:26:22,739
She, what? Dropsa plate of meatloaf,

473
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:24,308
doesn't get a tip.

474
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,610
Try to separate "mistake"from "result."

475
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:28,111
Getting backon the job, for you,

476
00:26:28,113 --> 00:26:29,613
is all about moving forward

477
00:26:29,615 --> 00:26:32,416
from a moment youcan never take back.

478
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:36,119
You need to talk to meabout that moment.

479
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,925
About seeing cell phoneand reacting "gun".

480
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,361
Mm-hmm.

481
00:26:44,363 --> 00:26:45,929
Can I make another appointment?

482
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,473
So, your twin,

483
00:26:56,475 --> 00:26:59,209
all hopped up on coptranquilizers,

484
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:01,111
guns down an innocentChinese lady

485
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,479
holding a cell phonein her hand.

486
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:03,847
Is that true?

487
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,649
I don't know.

488
00:27:05,651 --> 00:27:07,284
I'm not even sureher partner knows.

489
00:27:07,286 --> 00:27:09,686
Feels like she's lyingabout something.

490
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:12,055
With 75 grand in a new account?

491
00:27:12,057 --> 00:27:13,557
She's well dodgy.

492
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,259
Yeah, whatever she was into,

493
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,261
it drove her bloody nuts, yeah?

494
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:19,630
Yeah, suicide'sthrilling, agreed.

495
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:20,998
But, can we get the elephant

496
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,833
out of the room?

497
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,301
What?

498
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:26,236
Well, look at her.

499
00:27:26,238 --> 00:27:27,871
What?

500
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,206
You're related.

501
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,508
This could be your story.

502
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,876
It's not.

503
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:35,979
Every foster kid dreamsof their lost family.

504
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:37,147
Oh, my God.

505
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:40,117
Deep down, we allhope we're special.

506
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:44,254
Yeah, the last thingI am is special.

507
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,690
If that was my boyfriend,

508
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,191
I'd jump in frontof a train, too.

509
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,560
Don't say that.

510
00:27:49,562 --> 00:27:51,562
Paul's hot and you know it.

511
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:53,363
Oh, Vic is keening

512
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,632
like a banshee.He wants a funeral.

513
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,134
You can't have a funeral.

514
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,635
The whole sad point is

515
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,238
nobody would notice if I died.

516
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,573
What's this?Birth certificates?

517
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:03,974
Alison Hendrix,

518
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:06,710
Beth.

519
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:11,381
Katja Obinger.Born in Berlin.

520
00:28:11,383 --> 00:28:14,017
Sarah, their birthdates are all

521
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,385
within a month of yours.

522
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,753
It's a coincidence.

523
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,722
I don't care.

524
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,791
It's just a score, Fe.

525
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:22,526
Let me finish whatI started and then

526
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:24,795
I'll come backfor you and Kira, yeah?

527
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:26,797
Oh.

528
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,033
You're going todisappear again?

529
00:28:30,035 --> 00:28:32,769
Yeah, I have to, Fe.

530
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,205
There's dangerous shitin this life.

531
00:28:35,207 --> 00:28:36,840
Somebody keeps texting her.

532
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:39,543
Oh, texting. My God,how terrifying.

533
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:40,978
Look, Fe, sell the coke

534
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,479
and keep half the money

535
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:43,981
and give the otherhalf to Kira, yeah?

536
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,316
You left Kirawith Mrs S overnight

537
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:47,884
and you didn't come back

538
00:28:47,886 --> 00:28:50,087
for 10 months!

539
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,727
I'm trying to fix it.

540
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,495
Tell it to the angels, Sarah.

541
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,831
You're already dead.

542
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:33,563
Shit!

543
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:38,969
Beth!

544
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,138
Beth.

545
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,043
Hi.

546
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:48,045
Hey.

547
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,980
The clash?

548
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:52,916
Oh, yeah.Uh --

549
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,619
"London Calling."

550
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,287
The clash rock.

551
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:58,789
Yeah, but you don't.

552
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,960
Are you going somewhere?

553
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,429
Uh...

554
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:07,864
Uh...no.Just gym stuff.

555
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:10,567
Weren't you coming backon the weekend?

556
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:13,503
Well, I wanted to be here.

557
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,504
So?

558
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,175
Yeah?

559
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:19,609
How was the hearing?

560
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:23,213
Oh. Uh,I couldn't do it.

561
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,881
I couldn't do it.

562
00:30:24,883 --> 00:30:26,850
You skipped it?

563
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:29,252
No, um --

564
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:31,788
I...got sickto my stomach.

565
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,223
I basically puked on them.

566
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:35,659
Are you serious?

567
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:36,660
Yeah.

568
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,662
Yeah.

569
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,063
Don't worry.I'm okay.

570
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,598
Beth,

571
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,799
what's happened?

572
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:46,369
A lot.

573
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:50,073
Yeah, I know,but you're --

574
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:53,410
I'm what?

575
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,728
What'd you do to your hair?

576
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:01,685
Uh...nothing.

577
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,320
I got it cut.

578
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,255
It's longer.

579
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:08,291
It's just wet.

580
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:11,795
Something's different.

581
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:22,272
Bedroom.

582
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:23,273
Ah!

583
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,176
Ah!

584
00:31:30,414 --> 00:31:32,215
Right here.

585
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,480
Felix.

586
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:20,982
For crying out loud.

587
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:22,049
Felix.

588
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,220
I'm sorry, man. I don'tknow where else to go.

589
00:32:26,222 --> 00:32:28,256
The men's shelter?

590
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:33,227
What the hell happenedto your face?

591
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:34,595
I got in a fight.

592
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:35,863
Why, Vic?

593
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,965
Why are you such a dick?

594
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:40,368
I don't know.I'm angry.

595
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:45,173
Can I come in?

596
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:46,641
No!

597
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,809
Thanks.

598
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:54,215
I can't sleep.

599
00:32:54,217 --> 00:32:55,983
I keep seeing her face.

600
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:57,618
Yeah, me too.

601
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,986
Her pretty face.

602
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,688
Felix,

603
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,457
you and me, we have todo something.

604
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,093
There's just nogoddamn closure, bro.

605
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:08,262
We have to have, like, a...

606
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:10,464
a memorial sendoff,or something.

607
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,635
Okay, Vic.

608
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:16,804
We'll have a wake.

609
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,073
Really? See, that's whatI'm talking about, man,

610
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,308
coming together.

611
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,777
Yeah. Cremation'stoday. I'm buying.

612
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,779
Oh, shit. Yeah,it can't be today.

613
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:27,648
I got to call Glennand that bitch Sherry

614
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,150
and all her Montreal connects

615
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:30,651
are going to want to be there.

616
00:33:30,653 --> 00:33:32,220
No no, locals only, Vic.Fast and light,

617
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:33,588
all right?It's going to be

618
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,956
an intimate memorial pissup.

619
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,324
Okay.Come on, let's go.

620
00:33:36,326 --> 00:33:39,560
Can I...?Okay! That's --

621
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:40,728
Thank you.

622
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,396
All right, um --

623
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,032
you know what?First, though,

624
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,634
you need a shower and a Xanax.

625
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:47,802
Okay.

626
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,354
Mmm.Ah! Oh.

627
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:08,256
For real?

628
00:34:08,258 --> 00:34:11,759
That was amazing.

629
00:34:11,761 --> 00:34:13,461
Was it?

630
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:14,962
We haven't had that action

631
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:17,331
for, like, 2 years.

632
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:18,633
Uh,

633
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:21,702
I got up for the gym, Paul.

634
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:23,471
Okay.

635
00:34:23,473 --> 00:34:25,106
Well, you want to tell me

636
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,607
what happened at the hearing?

637
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:33,714
Uh, I choked, I guess.

638
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:35,483
They reconvenein a couple days.

639
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,485
Don't worry about it.

640
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:38,853
Beth.

641
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:40,988
Hmm? What?

642
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,324
Are you back on the meds?

643
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:47,528
No.

644
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,164
Then you didn't choke.

645
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,499
You're just finallyfeeling something.

646
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:54,969
Feeling like the real you.

647
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:56,837
I got up for the gym.

648
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,740
Are you driving today?

649
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:00,741
What?

650
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:03,044
Can I borrow the keysto your car?

651
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,912
Use your own car.

652
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:06,547
I can't find my keys.

653
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:08,683
Did you check the thingwhere they always are?

654
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:11,052
Yeah. Yeah,I checked the thing

655
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:12,486
where they always are.

656
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:23,831
Mm.

657
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:29,837
Okay.

658
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,581
Nice.

659
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,078
Felix!

660
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,481
We can't part angry this time.

661
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:14,982
It's not goodfor your skin, okay?

662
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,517
Call me, or I'll squeezeyour bloody bollocks

663
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:19,186
in a vise,you little --

664
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:20,821
Everything all right?

665
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:23,023
Yeah. ObnoxiousEnglish relative.

666
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,325
Oh.

667
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:27,928
Well, I've got your cash.

668
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,031
I just needyour signature here.

669
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:50,818
Okay.

670
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,457
Right, then.

671
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,058
All done.

672
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,671
Here.

673
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:13,374
Okay. Good luckwith that run.

674
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,423
Fe?

675
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:23,978
Felix.

676
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:29,149
You little shit.

677
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,526
Sarah had a big heart.

678
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:42,997
It was always fightor flight with her.

679
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,432
You guys rememberhow she was, right?

680
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:47,167
This is all based on facts.

681
00:38:47,169 --> 00:38:50,871
She was the kind ofperson you want to hang

682
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:54,642
on to, but she wouldnot be held, would she?

683
00:38:57,712 --> 00:38:59,847
Sarah, I'm sorry.

684
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,516
I know I have a lotto answer for.

685
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:06,787
My favorite moment --

686
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:08,289
So,

687
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,124
is it heaven or hell?

688
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,493
I didn't want a funeral,for this very reason, Fe.

689
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:14,895
Well, you can't do much aboutthat when you're dead, can you?

690
00:39:14,897 --> 00:39:17,565
I'm watching right now.

691
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:20,734
Really?Oh, well.

692
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,670
Pathetic.

693
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:24,371
Let me ask you --

694
00:39:24,373 --> 00:39:26,206
I dressed Vic.How do we look?

695
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,642
Yeah, not as goodas Rockabilly Bob.

696
00:39:28,644 --> 00:39:31,812
I know! Still Rockabilly,after all these years.

697
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:33,447
Got to respect that.

698
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:34,648
I want to sayshe was like an angel

699
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,617
that was puton earth --

700
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:38,085
Sherry's upset,though, in't she?

701
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:40,087
Oh, yeah, she thinksVic pushed you

702
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:41,422
in front of the train.

703
00:39:41,424 --> 00:39:42,756
It's priceless, really.

704
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,091
Eh, I got the money, Fe.

705
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:45,826
I still want us to be together.

706
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,194
It can work, yeah?

707
00:39:47,196 --> 00:39:49,229
This is our chance,for me, you, and Kira

708
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:50,965
to start over.Sarah, I --

709
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:53,300
Felix, do you mind?!I'm trying to --

710
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:54,935
Do you want us to goand come back?

711
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:57,605
Shit. I'm sorry, I -- Vic'sgetting mad. I got to go.

712
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,940
Could you hang up your phone?Oh, shit!

713
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:00,941
What?

714
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,476
Mrs S is there, Fe.

715
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:05,879
Shit.

716
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:07,715
Stop! Stop! Stop!

717
00:40:07,717 --> 00:40:09,049
Oh, shit.

718
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:10,985
No no no, Fe.

719
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:15,789
Oh, shit!

720
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,058
Ohh.

721
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,361
No Fe, Kira's there.

722
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,262
Uh --

723
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:26,000
she can't think I'm dead, Fe.

724
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:27,935
Fe?

725
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:31,271
Oh, my God, she can'tthink I'm dead.

726
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:52,937
Beth.

727
00:40:52,939 --> 00:40:54,705
Beth, why don't you respond

728
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,440
to me?

729
00:40:58,077 --> 00:40:58,901
Beth.

730
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,978
Just keep away from me.

731
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,948
Beth, it's Katja.

732
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,549
Oh, my God.Holy shit.

733
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:07,451
Why no meeting, Beth?What happening?

734
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:08,672
Uh --

735
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,354
I brought the briefcase, ja?

736
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:13,090
The sample foryour friend, Beth.

737
00:41:13,092 --> 00:41:14,592
I was careful, like you said.

738
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,660
Yeah, just stay back.

739
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:18,596
I'm Katja.Katja Obinger, Beth.

740
00:41:18,598 --> 00:41:20,398
Yeah, I get it,the German, okay?

741
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,817
I've seen yourbirth certificate.

742
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,301
Ja, you asked for it,for proof.

743
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:32,209
Please, I need to see

744
00:41:32,211 --> 00:41:34,945
your scientist friend, Beth.

745
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:37,348
Uh, I can't help you.

746
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:41,257
Get out of the car!

747
